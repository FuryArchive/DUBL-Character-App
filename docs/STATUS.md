# Current project status

Last refreshed: 2026-09-22

This is the living status document for Fury Book. Historical milestone reports may contain older product names and are not current branding or architecture authority.

## Product

- Product: **Fury Book**
- Current public product line: **0.5**
- Currently shipped ruleset: **DUBL 3.69**
- Frontends: Android + Compose Desktop (Linux/Windows)
- Web/Wasm, accounts and sync: out of current scope

Fury Book is the product shell and cross-platform application. DUBL is the current ruleset integration.

## Shared foundation

Android and Desktop use the same Kotlin Multiplatform model/rules/application layer.

Current hard boundaries:

- Namespace ownership: shared DUBL code is `com.furybook.dubl.*`, shared product UI is `com.furybook.ui.*`, and platform code is isolated under `com.furybook.android.*` / `com.furybook.desktop.*`.

- `DublApplication` is the public state-changing boundary for the current DUBL integration.
- canonical DUBL runtime catalogs live inside the bundled `dubl-3.69` Fury Content Pack.
- executable formulas belong in shared rules, not platform UI.
- typed shared golden/parity scenarios protect Android/Desktop behavior.
- local user overrides remain separate from immutable canonical ruleset data.

## Compatibility identities

Branding changes do not migrate stored data or package identities.

Kept stable intentionally:

- Android application ID: `com.dubl.character.android`
- current snapshot schema: **11**
- DUBL ruleset identity: `dubl / 3.69`
- transfer format: `dubl.character` version **1**
- Desktop local data identity: `dubl-character`

Product-facing names, installers, launchers and release artifacts use **Fury Book**.

## DUBL rulebook-first pipeline

The tracked DUBL ruleset control plane lives in `rulesets/dubl-3.69`.

The importer:

- extracts deterministic source IR from approved books;
- preserves source-qualified provenance;
- surfaces ambiguity/conflicts as diagnostics;
- requires explicit tracked resolutions for executable interpretations;
- keeps full generated bundles under ignored `build/rulesets/dubl-3.69`.

Do not infer a DUBL rule from current UI behavior when the rulebook source is ambiguous.

## Active implementation priorities

1. DUBL 3.69 correctness and domain promotion
2. Android/Desktop parity through shared application contracts
3. product/ruleset separation needed for future Fury Book rulesets
4. persistence / transfer compatibility
5. performance and interaction polish
6. reliable Android, Linux and Windows release gates

## Legacy / historical material

These remain historical context, not current implementation or branding authority:

- `docs/KMP_FOUNDATION_REPORT.md`
- `docs/DESKTOP_0_2_PARITY.md`
- `docs/DESKTOP_CHARACTER_SHEET_REPORT.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/`
- `packaging/linux/portable-src/`
- `packaging/linux/build-portable-appimage.sh`

## Verification

```bash
./gradlew :shared:desktopTest :desktopApp:compileKotlin
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug
```

For release/rulebook work, also run the relevant Python contract suite and importer validation documented by the workflow or README.
